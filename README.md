## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to write python because it's structure forces better format?<br>
Do you like readable and easily expandable code?<br>
Want to learn something through self explanatory code?

Then this repository is **not** for you. As a personal challenge for [AoC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022), I try to solve every problem using only one (1) line of code.

Performance is of little interest, as we all have to make sacrifices in the name of writing horrible python code.

## Prerequisites
To run this program, you'll need [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I run python 3.11, though lower versions would most likely also work). Every day has its own two oneliners - one for each part - alongside the given input in a folder. Additionally, within the source folder, there is one file named [all.py](./src/all.py), which should be updated each day to contain every single day.

All programs are intended to be run from within their folder. Running them from anywhere else would make the filenames invalid.

## Contributions
If you actually want to torture yourself trying to design a better (or worse?) oneliner, feel free to create pull requests. The same goes for any spelling mistakes or horrible explanations on my part.

## Preemptive apologies
Usually, projects like these end with me not having time for them anymore, so if you find this repository abandoned, this is most likely what happened.
